        <h3>Notes:</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Backslashes are used to escape special characters in your strings.
            For example when you need to quotes in your string. You also put it
            before a r for carriage return, a n to start new line, or a t for a
            Tab.
          </li>
          <li>
            <q
              >Primitive data types and objects have properties and methods.
              Properties are information about the object or value, while
              methods perform an action on the object or value ― either to
              change it or to tell us something about it.</q
            >
            (JN2N) <br />
            -I thought this was a good reminder on the differences.
          </li>
          <li>
            <q
              >A method is an action that a primitive data type or object can
              perform. To call a method, we use the dot operator (.) followed by
              the name of the method, followed by parentheses (this is a useful
              way to distinguish between a property and a method ― methods end
              with parentheses).</q
            >
            (JN2N) <br />-Parentheses are the best way to know if it's a method
            instead of a property.
          </li>
          <li>
            <q
              >Symbols are the only primitives that don't have a literal form.
              The only way to create them is to use the Symbol() function.</q
            >
            (JN2N) <br />
            -I hadn't learned about the Symbol() before.
          </li>
          <li>
            I love terary but they can get trick if you're not careful. The
            switch function is definitely makes code cleaner for long if else
            statements.
          </li>
          <li>
            <q
              >Don't Repeat Yourself, or DRY, is a principle of programming that
              specifies that every part of a program should only be written
              once. This avoids duplication and means there's no need to keep
              multiple pieces of code up to date and in sync.</q
            >(JN2N) <br />
            -This is good advice and a good way to remember it.
