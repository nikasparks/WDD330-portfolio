        at and worked with the story editor the most.
        <h3>Notes:</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Local storage is great for temporaily holding information or storing
            minimal information for functions or sites that don't need database
            support.
          </li>
          <li>
            “So...if your dealing with an input or textarea use value; a
            section, use innerHTML. Don't get these mixed up. If you do, your
            code will run without an error but your page won't get or display
            anything. Be careful. You'll just have to remember which word to use
            in these two different situations, input or textarea use value and
            section uses innerHTML.” -- I don't think I knew that before but I'm
            not sure why I didn't or didn't remember it...
          </li>
          <li>
            Design for moblie or small first and it'll be easier to make your
            site work for bigger screens. It doesn't work the other way around.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Questions:</h3>
