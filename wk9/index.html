            Prompt dialogs: "It's worth reiterating again that these methods
            will stop the execution of a program in its tracks. This means that
            everything will stop processing at the point the method is called,
            until the user clicks OK or Cancel. This can cause problems if the
            program needs to process something else at the same time or the
            program is waiting for a callback function. <br />There are some
            occasions when this functionality can be used as an advantage, for
            example, a window.confirm() dialog can be used as a final check to
            see if a user wants to delete a resource. This will stop the program
            from going ahead and deleting the resource while the user decides
            what to do. <br />It's also worth keeping in mind that most browsers
            allow users to disable any dialogs from repeatedly appearing,
            meaning they are not a feature to be relied upon."

            "The availHeight and availWidth can be used to find the height and
            width of the screen, excluding any operating system menus"
          </li>
          <li>
            The Screen object has more uses for mobile devices. It also allows
            you to do things like turn off the device's screen, detect a change
            in its orientation or lock it in a specific orientation. <br />
            Many of the methods and properties covered in the previous section
            were abused in the past for dubious activities such as user-agent
            sniffing, or detecting screen dimensions to decide whether or not to
            display certain elements. These practices have (thankfully) now been
            superseded by better practices, such as media queries and feature
            detection, which is covered in the next chapter.

            The use of document.write() is heavily frowned upon as it can only
            be realistically used by mixing JavaScript within an HTML document.
            There are still some extremely rare legitimate uses of it, but a
            ninja programmer will hardly ever need to use it.
