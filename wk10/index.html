            "It's worth reiterating again that these methods will stop the
            execution of a program in its tracks. This means that everything
            will stop processing at the point the method is called, until the
            user clicks OK or Cancel. This can cause problems if the program
            needs to process something else at the same time or the program is
            waiting for a callback function. <br />There are some occasions when
            this functionality can be used as an advantage, for example, a
            window.confirm() dialog can be used as a final check to see if a
            user wants to delete a resource. This will stop the program from
            going ahead and deleting the resource while the user decides what to
            do. <br />It's also worth keeping in mind that most browsers allow
            users to disable any dialogs from repeatedly appearing, meaning they
            are not a feature to be relied upon."
