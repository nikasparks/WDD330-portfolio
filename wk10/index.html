          <li>
            "Your apps should always perform security checks on any
            form-submitted data on the server-side as well as the client-side,
            because client-side validation is too easy to bypass, so malicious
            users can still easily send bad data through to your server."
          </li>
          <li>
            "Never trust data passed to your server from the client. Even if
            your form is validating correctly and preventing malformed input on
            the client-side, a malicious user can still alter the network
            request."
          </li>
          <li>
            "There are two different types of client-side validation that you'll
            encounter on the web:
            <ul>
              <li>
                Built-in form validation uses HTML form validation features,
                which we've discussed in many places throughout this module.
                This validation generally doesn't require much JavaScript.
                Built-in form validation has better performance than JavaScript,
                but it is not as customizable as JavaScript validation.
              </li>
              <li>
                JavaScript validation is coded using JavaScript. This validation
                is completely customizable, but you need to create it all (or
                use a library)."
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            "For good user experience, indicate to the user when form fields are
            required. It isn't only good user experience, it is required by WCAG
            accessibility guidelines. Also, only require users to input data you
            actually need"
          </li>
          <li>
            "The fetch specification differs from jQuery.ajax() in the following
            significant ways:
            <ul>
              <li>
                The Promise returned from fetch() won't reject on HTTP error
                status even if the response is an HTTP 404 or 500. Instead, as
                soon as the server responds with headers, the Promise will
                resolve normally (with the ok property of the response set to
                false if the response isn't in the range 200-299), and it will
                only reject on network failure or if anything prevented the
                request from completing.
              </li>
              <li>
                Unless fetch() is called with the credentials option set to
                include, fetch(): won't send cookies in cross-origin requests
                won't set any cookies sent back in cross-origin responses As of
                August 2018, the default credentials policy changed to
                same-origin. Firefox was also modified in version 61.0b13)"
