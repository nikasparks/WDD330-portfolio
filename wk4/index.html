        <a href="wk1/exercises/story_writer.html">Week 1 exercise</a> - I looked
        at and worked with the story editor the most.
        <h3>Notes:</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Square bracket notation (e.g. const form =
            document.forms['search'];) can be used and is required if the form's
            name attribute contains any invalid characters, such as spaces or
            dashes
          </li>
          <li>
            Reset buttons are generally considered poor for usability, as they
            are too easy to click and then wipe out all the data that's been
            entered. So think very carefully before using one in a form.
          </li>
          <li>
            "By convention, the names of constructor functions or class
            declarations are capitalized, which is the convention used for
            classes in class-based programming languages."
          </li>
          <li>
            "These are sometimes called class methods in other programming
            languages. A static method is called by the class directly rather
            than by instances of the class."
          </li>
          <li>
            "JavaScript uses a prototypal inheritance model. This means that
            every class has a prototype property that is shared by every
            instance of the class. So any properties or methods of a class's
            prototype can be accessed by every object instantiated by that
            class."
          </li>
          <li>
            "A golden rule to remember is: Never use arrays or objects as a
            default value in prototype. This is not a problem if arrays or
            objects are set as default values from within the constructor
            function in the class declaration."
          </li>
          <li>
            "To summarize, the following points should be considered when using
            classes and prototypes to create instances:
            <ul>
              <li>
                Create a class declaration that deals with any initialization,
                shared properties and methods.
              </li>

              <li>
                Any extra methods and properties that need to be augmented to
                the class declaration after it's been defined can be added to
                the prototype. These will be added to all instances, even those
                that have already been created.
              </li>

              <li>
                Add any properties or methods that are individual to a
                particular instance can be augmented using assignment to that
                object (a mixin could be used to add multiple properties at
                once, as we'll see later).
              </li>

              <li>
                Be careful when overwriting the prototype completely â€• the
                constructor class needs to be reset."
