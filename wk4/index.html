        <h3>Notes:</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Square bracket notation (e.g. const form =
            document.forms['search'];) can be used and is required if the form's
            name attribute contains any invalid characters, such as spaces or
            dashes
          </li>
          <li>
            Reset buttons are generally considered poor for usability, as they
            are too easy to click and then wipe out all the data that's been
            entered. So think very carefully before using one in a form.
